## Installation

Install this library in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) using pip. virtualenv is a tool to
create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of
dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With virtualenv, it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

### Mac/Linux

```
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv <your-env>
source <your-env>/bin/activate
<your-env>/bin/pip install
```

### Windows

```
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv <your-env>
<your-env>\Scripts\activate
<your-env>\Scripts\pip.exe install
```
